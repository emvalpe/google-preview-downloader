# google-preview-downloader
a quick script to take google books that offer a preview and download them for free, also the UI for the preview is awful so hopefully you can use a better one on your own computer.

- run main.py in the project directory
- after it has finished you will find a folder with the title of your book in the project directory

Notes:
 - Book has to be previewable
